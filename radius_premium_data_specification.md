## RADIUS Site Details
- User can expand or collapse the Site Details Panel by clicking on the "Site Details" button in the Subject Site.
- Site Details are displayed in an expansion panel that extends to the right of the Subject Site.
- The Site Detail Panel is composed of Parcel selection tabs and multiple categorical accordion drawers.
- The top Site Detail drawer is labeled **Site Overview**, is open by default, and visible to all clients including Discovery/Free users.
- Subsequent Site Detail drawers are closed by default and can only be opened by Paid Subscribers, Essentials and up.
- User Experience Note: Opening a Drawer closes all other open drawers, similar to the Product Menu operation.

## Site Search Flow
- The Site Search flow should leverage the Site Details panel in place of the existing **Site Attributes** display.  This may require some subtle changes to the various use cases.
