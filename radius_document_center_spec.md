# RADIUS Document Center
## Document Center
- The Document Center is directly accessible from the Saved Subject Site via the existing **Documents** button. 
- The Document Center is also accessible during the Project [Order Flow](radius_order_process_spec.md). 
- Documents can be added to the Saved Subject Site at any time prior to or during Project execution.
- The Document Center should use a Drag and Drop style interface.
- Clients are prompted to identify the Document Category in the standard document upload.
- If multiple Documents are uploaded at once, the client is required to categorize each document before closing the dialog.  
- Documents required by the Product Type are indicated as required in the Document Center and the client is given a path to upload the appropriate document directly, skipping the Product category selection.  
- Required Documents appear in the Document Center any time the associated Product is present in the Project. (i.e. Title Commitment for Survey) 
- Client provided documents are displayed separately from CREtelligent provided documents.
- Each PDF document in the Document Center can be easily viewed in the RADIUS PDF Viewer component.
- RADIUS user can copy a link to any document in the Document Center.
- Client can edit the Document Category for any given Client Provided Document.  

## The Document Center is a RADIUS Point Solution.  
- A Direct Project link that redirects the user to the Project with the Document Center already launched.
