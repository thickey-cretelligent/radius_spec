# RUSH PRICING Process

## Overview

**Rush** Pricing is provided to clients via RADIUS and TRACKER.  During the checkout process, client can select a "Rush" option on any Quoted Product.  The client is prompted to provide a "Desired By" date and the request is sent to Consult in Quote Manager.  Using the provided "Desired By" Date, solicit pricing from Professional Associates using the Network engagement process.   

## PLATFORM Rush Process

### Rush Selector
The Rush Selector is a simple checkbox presented to the user during the checkout flow and to the internal user in Quote Manager.  

### Desired By Date
A “Desired by” date picker is visible for all Quoted Products in RADIUS and TRACKER. When **Rush** is selected, the “Desired by” date becomes required for the user.  When the "Desired By" date is populated with a date prior to the standard turn around time, notify the user that **Rush** pricing may be required.

### ClickQuote
**Rush** requests are automatically considered *Consult* and should skip any Click Quote bidding automation in RADIUS.

### Quote Manager
Prominently display the “Rush” request along with “Desired by” date in both the Quote Manager display (At the top level) and in the Proposal screen.  

### CONNECT
PA’s in CONNECT provide bids based on an adjusted “Desired by” date rather than providing a Turn Around time in business days.  

- Include a prominent indicator in the email to the PA indicating that the invitation is for a RUSH request to ensure timely bidding.  
- When “Rush” requests are pushed to CONNECT, the “Desired by” date, minus 1 business day, takes the place of the “Turn Around Time” field in CONNECT.
- Due to time sensitivity, Time box the bid requests to 24 hours and communicate time box to the PA.

### Proposal
The Proposal communicates the Rush Pricing based on the clients Desired By date rather than a Turn around Time in business days.  Given that the Proposal is now time sensitive and resources may be waiting for authorization to proceed, the Proposal must be signed within 24 hours for CREtelligent to honor the pricing and date commitment.  

- The Proposal displays the Estimated Delivery date set to the “Desired By” date instead of the TAT.  
- The Proposal prominently displays that the Proposal pricing and date commitment are only valid for “Same Day Authorization” (24 hours).
- The Rush pricing with Estimated Delivery set to the “Desired By” date in also visible in the RADIUS interactive Proposal.  

### TRACKER
The “Updated Due Date” should display the “Desired by” date assuming that the Proposal was signed within 24 hours of delivery.  

- Users attempting to change the “Updated Due Date” should be prompted that the Order has a Hard Due Date and any changes should be authorized by the Client.


As a rule, when the TAT is > 10 days, the Desired By date in CONNECT is TAT -2 Business Days.  When the TAT is < 10 days, the Desired by date in CONNECT is TAT -1 Business Day.  This is true for all requests regardless of RUSH status.
